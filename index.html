									<h2>After hobby programming since Febuary 2015, I knew that coding was the greatest passion I had.</h2>
								</header>
								<p>I signed on for the <em>Web Development Immersive</em> course with GA and became skilled in <strong>JavaScript</strong> along with modern full stack libraries. I started coding in 2009 when I took an introduction to <strong>Java</strong> at university. Since then I have dabbled in <strong>C</strong>, <strong>C++</strong> <strong>C#</strong> and <strong>Python</strong> before starting my course with GA.</p>
								<p>Immediatly after GA, I started working for Yoti as a full stack developer and have worked with many modern frameworks such as Node, Angular and React.</p>

										<h3>CoffeeCoder</h3>
									</header>
									<p><strong>CoffeeScript REPL and learning environment</strong></p>
									<p>CoffeeCoder was my final week long project at General Assembly. CoffeeCoder is way to learn and teach CoffeeScript with quick modular lessons that can be attempted in an online REPL and written by any registered member. CoffeeCoder utilises the full MEAN stack and was incredibly rewarding and fun to build! I also utilised Mocha with Chai to make the backend in a TDD fashion.</p>
									<h3>Tech Used:</h3>
									<p><strong>Node.JS, Express, MongoDB, Angular.JS, Mocha, Chai, Bootstrap</strong></p>

										<h3>Dwarven Defender</h3>
									</header>
									<p><strong>JavaScript web game</strong></p>
									<p>Dwarven Defender is a clicker type game inspired by titles such as 'Cookie Clicker' and 'Clicker Heroes'. The game can be played indefinitely, with the enemy HP and damage scaling exponentially as the player progresses. This was built purely with HTML5 and CSS3. Once the stage was set, I built all the logic and movement of the ‘enemy’ div with OOP JavaScript and jQuery.</p>
									<h3>Tech Used:</h3>
									<p><strong>HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery</strong></p>

										<h3>Carboot</h3>
									</header>
									<p><strong>Trading app build on Rails</strong></p>
									<p>Carboot is an item trading system that allows users to exchange items in a one-to-one manner. Carboot uses a minimal, clean user interface for ease of use and takes inspiration from trading systems found in modern massively multiplayer online games. Carboot was the first project I made in Ruby on Rails and utilises the backend fully with multiple models. The frontend uses Foundation as its framework.</p>
									<h3>Tech Used:</h3>
									<p><strong>Ruby on Rails, Passport, Paperclip, Foundation, PostgreSQL</strong></p>

										<h3>Anansi</h3>
									</header>
									<p><strong>Event agnostic adaptation of HackJammer</strong></p>
									<p>Anansi was written and after the HackJammer project as an adaptation of it. Anansi allows a user to search for any event via the eventful crawler that I wrote that utilises asynchronous lookups. Once the results come back in, the Google Map plugin renders the pins with the event details at the event location. I also fixed up some issues in HackJammer such as controlled sending of requests to the Google Geocoder API.</p>
									<h3>Tech Used:</h3>
									<p><strong>jQuery, Node.JS, Express, MongoDB, Google API, Async</strong></p>
