## About

Hi there! I'm an aspiring Web Developer who currently lives in London. I originally studied at Staffordshire university in the field of computer networking, earning a first class degree and winning the award for the highest score across all undergraduate programs. Shortly before graduating, I was headhunted and immediatly started working for Cisco Systems with thier Cloud Networking Group for 2 years until the end of September 2015. My job with the CNG was working with customers to support thier networks and thier experience working with our beautiful web app. As time progressed, and after many times practising coding late into the night, I knew that building and evolving web apps was my true passion. I have now almost completed a 12-week intensive coding acadamy course with General Assembly and I'm looking to make a real impact.
